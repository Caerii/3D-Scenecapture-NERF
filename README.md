# 3D-Scenecapture-NERF
DTU Computational Photography Project

## Aim
The aim of this project is to have a web-based mobile application platform to send images to a server in order to process them into NERFs.

## Description
The NERFs are 3d reconstructions of the light field of a series of images. This allows one to fly around and create novel views.
